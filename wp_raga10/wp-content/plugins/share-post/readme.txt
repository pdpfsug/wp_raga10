== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are social bookmarking buttons? =

Social bookmarking refers to sharing links on social sites like Facebook. It's just another term for sharing buttons. Facebook's Like button, Twitter's Tweet buttons, etc are all examples of social bookmarking buttons.

= What makes this plugin better than the other similar plugins? =

No other plugin:<ol>
<li>Has real-time counts of clicks</li>
<li>Does not require Javascript</li>
<li>Does not break HTML validation and</li>
<li>Works perfectly in all major browsers</li>
</ol>

= What are the counters? =

The counters included with every button is a real-time (live) count of the number of clicks each button has.

= Will this plugin work in Internet Explorer? =

Yes. Share Post is able to detect browsers with PHP and display different codes for buggy browsers like Internet Explorer (even the older versions).

= My website is not in English, the Like button is cut off =

To fix this, simply add `.splike,.splike iframe,.splike object{width:150px;}` to your custom CSS. You have to adjust the width accordingly.

This plugin can be easily customized using the many customization settings. The built-in API allows you to modify the buttons in any way you want.

= How do I display the buttons outside the loop? =

You can put `<?php sharepost_buttons($post_id); ?>` anywhere in your template to display social bookmarking buttons for the provided post ID.

= Will more buttons be added? =

Definitely! Just tell me the ones you want and I'll add it in the next version.
